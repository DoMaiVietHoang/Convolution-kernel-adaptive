# Convolution adaptive kernel
None
This repository demonstrates adaptive convolution kernels for deep learning models.  
It contains code and examples for using convolutional layers with dynamically changing kernel shapes or sizes, which can improve model flexibility and performance in various computer vision tasks.
## Features
- Adaptive convolutional layers
- Example models and training scripts
- Utilities for data loading and processing
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (see requirements.txt or use pip install torch, numpy, etc.).
3. Explore the example scripts and models in the ARConv directory.
## Usage

Refer to the code in `ARConv/models/` for adaptive convolution implementations.  
You can run training or testing scripts as provided, or integrate the adaptive convolution layers into your own models.
## License

This project is for research and educational purposes.

**Note: All code is coming soon.**
